# AdfluenceFlow

As part of my Modern Application Development course at IIT Madras, I developed an Influencer Engagement and Sponsorship Coordination Platform using flask that bridges sponsors and influencers, facilitating seamless collaborations for mutual benefit.

The problem statement was to make a software which connect Sponsors and Influencers so that sponsors can get their product/service advertised and influencers can get monetary benefit.

Implemented features include creating and managing campaigns, two-way request handling and negotiation, dummy payment processing, and PDF+CSV transaction reporting. Utilized role-based access control for user authentication and authorization.

Additionally, I created RESTful APIs for each model in the database.

üóùÔ∏è Key Features:
- Sponsors can easily find the right influencers for their products/services
- Influencers can monetize their reach and creativity
- Seamless campaign management and tracking
- User authentication and personalized profiles
- Booking system for influencer-sponsor collaborations
- Rating and feedback mechanism
- Comprehensive admin dashboard with analytics
- Interactive charts for data visualization (using ChartJS)
